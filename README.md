# Business Strategy on Discounts
This repository showcases a structured approach to using data for business decision-making. From messy raw data to a polished strategic recommendation, the process highlights the value of data cleaning, exploration, and communication. In this repository, I explore whether offering product discounts aligns with a tech company's business strategy. The analysis involves handling raw data, performing rigorous cleaning, and applying analytical techniques to generate insights and recommendations.

## Project Objectives
This project centers on answering two core business questions:
1.	Do discounts support or hinder the company’s long-term strategy?
2.	How can the company improve its data collection processes?

## Business Context
Company: Eniac
Industry: Tech products & accessories
Location: Europe
Eniac faces an internal debate:
•	Marketing Team’s View: Discounts enhance customer acquisition, boost satisfaction and retention, and ultimately fuel business growth.
•	Board's Concern: Heavy discounts may undermine profitability. Despite increased order volume, the latest quarterly report showed declining revenue. The Board prefers to maintain a quality-oriented market position rather than competing on low prices.
